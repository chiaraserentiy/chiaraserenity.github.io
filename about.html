    About Chiara Loden</h2>
    <p>I am Chiara (key-are-uh) Loden and I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in English. I am passionate about creative writing, especially poetry and excited to be finally sharing some through this website. My most recent publication was a creative non-fiction short story entitled "Mud Pies to Machetes" which was published December 2023, in Inkblot.
      <br>
      My family of eight (those still at home) currently live in Washington, but I moved around to all sorts of locations growing up, including Baltimore, Maryland; Gresham, Oregon; and Sydney, Australia (ten out of ten would recommend). I'm excited to as I embark in a new part of life--I just got married! Along with my husband, I live with the constant presence of my Celiac disease and all the joys that brings. I love reading Agatha Christie and Lois Lowry books while I eat my gluten free treats!
