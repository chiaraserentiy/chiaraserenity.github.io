		<h2>Poetry</h2>
	<p><h3>Recently Featured Poem by Benjamin Loden</h3>
		I want to make it sound like me,
	<br>
But I want to have nice imagery.
	<br>
I'm not very good at poetry.
	<br>
Maybe this just isn't for me.
	<br>
	<br>

But if, for even just one day,
	<br>
I finally found what I want to say,
	<br>
And it stayed around, long enough to know em'
	<br>
I think I'd call it a poem.
