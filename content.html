  <h2><br>
    The Ankle</h2>
	<h3>Prose Poem by Chiara Loden</h3>
  <p>She knew that someday her doctor would take her ankle and she would regret being his daughter. Her ankle was swollen, a bruised kind of swollen that left the tall girl limping as she hobbled over cobbled stones. In the dusk of a swollen moon, the girl looked at her father while he puffed on a pine pipe with huffs of hot summer air. Her ankle twitched as she impatiently waited for his response. And eventually, he spoke up and told her of the endless, futuristic plans of his nurses and they all involved her ankle. The girl’s twitching stopped, as she said to her father, “I’ll never let you do that to your only daughter.” He just laughed, staring at her ankle with a fondling, desperate attention.</p>

    Butterfly Poet</h2>
	<h3> Poem by Chiara Loden</h3>
  <p>A poet publishing their first work <br>
    is a butterfly opening its wings; <br>
    the ink on the page <br>
    is the splash of finger paints on the membranes, <br>
    the clicking fingers <br>
    are the antennae harvesting rhymes, <br>
    the tears on hot cheeks <br>
    are the legs tickling the frills of a mum, <br>
    the editor is the steady support of the belly <br>
    whose tweaks and critiques <br>
    are the spread veins in the wings, <br>
    the stained thumbprints of this overtired artist <br>
    are left by the butterfly’s friend, thumbelina <br>
    to mark a path to the overdue fortune of publication. </p>

  <h2><br>
    Cafe Confusion</h2>
	<h3>Creative Non-Fiction by Chiara Loden</h3>
  <p>Hum along with Ed Sheeran on a Pop Pandora station. Mix a little more sugar in Barb’s mocha. Turn to your co-worker, Danica, and say, remember how Barb always says mocha latte? A mocha drink is always going to have milk in it of some variety. It’s just a mocha. You know Barb likes oat milk best, so don’t ask.</p>
  <p> Watch as the day brings in a handful more customers. The day being rainy, drippy—too wet for sidewalk strolling so they meander in to order their third cup of coffee for the day. Overloads of caffeine never grow old for the population of Tysons. I’ll have two lattes with skim milk they’ll say. Tell each of them—Paul and Jordan and nameless Jane—you have no skim milk. Whole, oat, or almond, you say. Repeatedly.</p>
  <p>Retrieve a coconut pecan cupcake for a woman with a nut-brown pixie cut when you hear the gentleman with a stiff beard behind her talking over the phone to a woman. See that he is not here for himself, he is grabbing something for the woman on the phone. They are on video call and you see him desperately turning the phone to encapsulate each goodie, one by one in all their blurry haven.</p>
  <p>Your most regular customer walks in sounding a hullo. Immediately move to the coffee grinder. Make their light-iced double-shot latte, two pumps of vanilla, one pump of caramel with almond milk. Now Jula can drink it in line while the three people in front of her subtly seethe. Ignore their distaste for you. Tell the woman with the pixie cut she looks so cute. Recognize the man with a stiff beard doesn’t need more than a smile. Notice he gives you an abnormally large tip when you ring up his espresso. Even the woman with the pixie cut gives in to the stare you give her as you turn the iPad screen around. Just follow the prompts on the screen, you tell her, it will ask if you would like to leave a tip and receive a receipt.</p>
  <p>Check your watch for the fifth time this hour. Only one-thirty in the afternoon, you have two more hours to go. At two, a couple arrives and asks for your boss by name. Realize this is the couple your boss mentioned earlier that would be coming to do cake testing for their upcoming wedding. Your boss is busy making a crepe for the man with the stiff beard so tell the eager couple she will be out in a couple of minutes. Check on Barb. Her mocha is perfect, but can you get her a napkin? There are napkins on the condiment table, but just grab one yourself and hand it to her graciously.</p>
  <p>Once three comes, run to the door to lock it before anyone else can come in. You don’t make it. A new customer holds the door handle as you are ten feet away. Sigh because you would rather help them than turn them away. Your boss profits more from you helping them. Respect your boss enough that you want that profit for her.</p>
  <p>Let the customer at the door in. He wants an americano, but you have already cleaned the espresso machine, so refuse this request. How about a cold brew, you ask. Or a coffee scone? He takes five minutes to look around before he decides that the price isn’t worth it if he isn’t getting his americano. Smile radiantly as he leaves, wishing he hadn’t just wasted five freaking minutes of your life. Your comfort is that you will be home in a half hour… if you’re willing to spend twenty dollars on a Lyft ride.</p>
  <p>At home, wipe the coffee off your sweaty forehead and kick off your espresso-stained Kiziks. You just can’t wait to start this all over again tomorrow.</p>
